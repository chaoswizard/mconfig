#mConfig#

##Getting It##

Download and run install.sh

    bash <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/mckeimic/mconfig/master/install.sh)

##Updating It##

I recommend going into the installation directory (probably ~/.mconfig/) and doing a git pull; if you set it up without git though you're on your own.
